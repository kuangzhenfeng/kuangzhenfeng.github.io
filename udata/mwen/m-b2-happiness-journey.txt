<b>双语美文:Happiness is a journey</b>

We always convince ourselves that life will be better after we get married, have a baby, than another. Then we are frustrated that the kids aren't old enough and we'll be more content when they are. After that we're frustrated that we have teenagers to deal with. We will certainly be happy when they are out of that stage.
我们总是说服自己，认为当我们结婚、生子后日子会过的更加舒心些。然后我们又被那些小鬼的不懂事搞得不顺心，当他们大了些后，情况会好些吧。当孩子到了青春期的时候，（有时）对于如何跟他们好好交流又会使我们很无措。我们都深信当他们过了那个年龄段后，事情就会有些转机。

We always tell ourselves that our life will be complete when our spouse gets his or her act together. When we get a nice car, and are able to go on a nice vocation when we retire. The truth is, there's no better time than right now. If not now, when? Our life will always be filled with challenges. It's best to admit this to ourselves and decide to be happy anyway.
我们总是对自己说，当另一半有条理的过活时，（我们的）人生就会很圆满。当我们买了一台漂亮的车子后，我们认为可以在年老退休后开去度假。可事实上，再也没有比当下更好的时间段了，要不是现在这时，那么还能是什么时候呢？我们的人生满是各种神奇的未知数。不管怎么说，对你我而言，最好是承认活在当下里的意义然后及时“自己给自己找乐”。

One of my favorite quotes comes from Alfred Souza. He said, "for a long time it had seemed to me that life was about to begin - real life. But there was always some obstacle in the way, someting to be gotten through first, some unfinished business, time still to be served, a debt to be paid. Then life would begin. At last it dawned on me that these obstacles were my life."
我最看中一段尔弗雷德·苏泽说过的话。他说“一直以来，我感觉的是真正的生活就要来了。但是在前面总有些东西拦在那里，一些问题必须先被搞定后才能进行下一项，比如未完成的工作，（做事时）等着轮到自己的那段时间、等待着交钱的帐单。当这些事解决后你才能开始自己的一天。后来我才觉悟到解决这些生活琐事的时候就是我的人生。”

This perspective has helped me to see that there is no way to happiness. Happiness is the way. So treasure every moment that you have.
这样的想法使我认识到，幸福是没有方式去追求寻找的。因为寻找幸福的过程本身就是幸福。所以珍惜你所拥有的点点滴滴。

And remember that time waits for no one. So stop waiting until you finish school, until you go back to school; until you get married, until you get divorced; until you have kids; until you retire; until you get a new car or home; until spring; until you are born again to decide that there is no better time than right now to be happy…
而且还要牢记时光不会等待垂青你我。于事莫等到你毕业之后、重返校园之时再去等待（幸福）；莫身陷围城之中，来来往往，进进出出后才去等待（幸福）；莫等到你膝下饶子、莫等到你老来归园、莫等到你了自己的新车、莫等到你乔迁新居、莫等到早春迟来、莫等到你重获新生后才认识到人生本是‘莫待来日，及时行乐 ’……

Happiness is a journey, not a destination. So, work like you don't need money, love like you've never been hurt, and dance like no one's watching.
寻找幸福的过程本身就是幸福，这条路上没有终点站。那么，你就要像不愁薪水那般去工作；敞开心扉那般去欢爱；旁若无人那般去歌舞。
