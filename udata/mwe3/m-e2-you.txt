<b>威廉·华兹华斯：我似流云天自游</b>

I wandered lonely as a cloud
我独游于天际，如一朵流云
 
That floats on high o'er vales and hills,
凌空于谷峰，飘然然悠闲。
 
When all at once I saw a crowd,
忽地，我看见了一群，
 
A host, of golden daffodils;
一簇簇金黄色的水仙；
 
Beside the lake, beneath the trees,
看在树之荫，湖之缘，
 
Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.
在微风中，她们舞姿翩翩。
 
Continuous as the stars that shine
她们似银河星钻，连延不断，
 
And twinkle on the milky way,
碧银银，闪闪发光，
 
They stretched in never-ending line
沿着湖湾的水缘线，
 
Along the margin of a bay:
伸向无穷无尽的远方：
 
Ten thousand saw I at a glance,
一瞥去便是一万朵，
 
Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.
轻舞中花首频颠簸。

The waves beside them danced; but they
波光里的涟漪也舞弄清影，却
 
Out-did the sparkling waves in glee:
怎比得水仙的欢快；
 
A poet could not but be gay,
伴有这等喜悦，
 
In such a jocund company:
诗人如何不快！
 
I gazed--and gazed--but little thought
我久久凝视但毫无答复，
 
What wealth the show to me had brought:
可知这景致给予我多少财富：
 
For oft, when on my couch I lie
每当我久卧不眠，
 
In vacant or in pensive mood,
心绪空荡，或忧思难抱，
 
They flash upon that inward eye
她们便闪现在心田，
 
Which is the bliss of solitude;
正如寂寥中的光照；
 
And then my heart with pleasure fills,
于是我的心儿满溢着欢畅，
 
And dances with the daffodils.
同这群水仙起舞歌唱！
