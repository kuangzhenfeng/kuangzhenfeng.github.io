<b>THE SCENT OF SPRING 春天的味道</b>

The village is full of the colour of white, and noises
Acacia flowers are blooming, attracting the wings of bees
To be covered with pollens of the sunshine
If you mix acacia flowers with flour and steam it—
We take a short cut to get ahead of the bees
And smell the scent of spring
“Acacia honey, acacia honey—“ Beekeepers
Prolongs his cry
And the road from  to the beehives are prolonged as well

满沟的白，满沟的吵闹
洋槐花开了，它让蜜蜂的翅膀
沾满了阳光的花粉
把洋槐花和着麦面蒸熟——
我们抄捷径赶在蜜蜂前头
尝到了春天的味道
“槐花蜜槐花蜜——”养蜂人
在楼下叫卖的声音拖得很长
像从洋槐花到蜂巢的路一样长
