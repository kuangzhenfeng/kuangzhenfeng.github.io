<b>诗歌英译：《枫桥夜泊》</b>

枫桥夜泊
张继

月落乌啼霜满天，
江枫渔火对愁眠。
姑苏城外寒山寺，
夜半钟声到客船。

Mooring at Night by the Maple Bridge
Zhang Ji
Tr. Zhao Yanchun

The moon setting, crows cawing, frost overfilling the skies,
The maples riv’rside, lamps aboard, sad the fishermen’s eyes.
The toll from the Cold Mountain Temple outside of Suchow
Reaches my boat at midnight and floods my sleepless sorrow.
