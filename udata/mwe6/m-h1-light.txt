<b>是你，点燃了我的生命</b>

You Light up My Life!
是你，点燃了我的生命！

Be good to every one who becomes attached to us; cherish every friend who is by our side;
善待，每一个和我们结缘的人；珍惜，我们身边的每一个朋友；

love every one who walks into our life.
爱，生命中，每一个和我们结缘的人。

It must be fate to get acquainted in a huge crowd of people...
茫茫的人海中，相识，其实，就是缘份……

I feel, the love that Osho talks about, maybe is a kind of pure love beyond the mundane world, which is full of divinity and caritas, and overflows with Buddhist allegorical words and gestures,
感觉，奥修所说的，也许是一种纯净、超越世俗和男女，充满神性和佛性的博爱，弥发，一种禅性和机锋

but, it seems that I cannot see through its true meaning forever...
而我，却好像永远，都，无法参透……

Maybe, I do not just "absorb" your love; but because the love overpowers me and I am unable to dispute and refuse it...
也许，我并不只是"接受"；而是，因为那种爱，让我，情不自禁、无法抗拒、不能拒绝……

Do you know? It's you who light up my life! And I stubbornly believe that such love can only be experienced once in my life.
知道吗？是你，点燃了我的生命！而我，固执的相信，这种情感，在我的生命中，只有一次。

Because of love, we won't be lonely any more; because of yearning, we taste more loneliness.
因为爱，我们，不再孤单；因为思念，品尝，更多的寂寞。
