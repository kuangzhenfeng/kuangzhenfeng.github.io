food contamination

government officials are neglectful of their duties

为官不为

Some government officials are neglectful of their duties, holding onto their jobs while failing to fulfill their responsibilities.

to deal simultaneously with the slowdown in economic growth, making difficult structural adjustments, and absorbing the effects of the previous economic stimulus policies

三期叠加

In its current stage of development, China has to deal simultaneously with the slowdown in economic growth, making difficult structural adjustments, and absorbing the effects of the previous economic stimulus policies. As resource-related and environmental constraints grow and costs for labor and other factors of production rise, a model of development that draws on high levels of investment and energy consumption and is heavily driven by quantitative expansion becomes difficult to sustain. We must therefore improve the economic structure while ensuring steady growth.

我国发展面临“三期叠加”矛盾，资源环境约束加大，劳动力等要素成本上升，高投入、高消耗、偏重数量扩张的发展方式已经难以为继，必须推动经济在稳定增长中优化结构。

It goes without saying that powers should not be held without good reason.

大道至简，有权不可任性。
