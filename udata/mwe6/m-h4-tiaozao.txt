<b>疯狂的笑话：那个女人有跳蚤</b>

“Please keep your dog beside you, sir,” a woman said crossly to the man sitting opposite to her on the bench at the park. “I can feel a flea in my shoe.” “Midnight, come here,” replied the man. “This woman has fleas.” 

“请把您的狗拴在您身边，先生，”一个女人生气地对坐在她对面公园长椅上的男人说， “我能感觉到跳蚤在我鞋里。”该男子回答道，“午夜，快到这来，那个女人有跳蚤”。
