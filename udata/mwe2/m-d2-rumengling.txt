<b>古诗英译：李清照《如梦令》</b>

Like a Dream
Li Qingzhao

The dusk at the river arbor I often recall.
Blind-drunk, our way back we remembered not at all!
Having had much fun, we paddled homebound
And strayed into lotus flowers profound.
Tried to get through,
Tried to get through!
So startled, all egrets from the shoal flew.

如梦令
诗/李清照

常记溪亭日暮，
沉醉不知归路。
兴尽晚回舟，
误入藕花深处。
争渡，
争渡，
惊起一滩鸥鹭。

轻松一刻：总感到口渴

"I had an operation," said a man to his friend, "and the doctor left a sponge in me."
一个男人对他的朋友说：“我动了一次手术，手术后医生把一块海绵忘在我的身体里了。”

"That's terrible!" said the friend. "Got any pain?"
“真是太糟糕了！”朋友说道：“你觉得疼吗？”

"No, but I am always thirsty!"
“不疼，可是我总感到口渴。”
