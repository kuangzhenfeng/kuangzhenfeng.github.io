The Rainy Day 
By Henry Wadsworth Longfellow
(亨利.沃兹渥斯.朗费罗)

The day is cold,and dark,and dreary;
天冷、阴暗、沉闷；

It rains,and the wind is never weary;
下着雨，风也刮个不停；

The vine still clings to the moldering wall,
藤还攀附着颓垣残壁，

But at every gust the dead leaves fall,
每来一阵狂风，枯叶附落纷纷，

And the day is dark and dreary.
天真是阴暗而沉闷。

My life is cold and dark and dreary;
我的生活寒冷、阴郁、沉闷；

It rains and the wind is never weary;
下着雨，风也刮个不停；

My thought still clings to the moldering past,
我的思想还纠缠着消逝的往事，

But the hopes of youth fall thick in the blast,
大风里，我的青春希望相继熄灭，

And the days are dark and dreary.
天真是阴暗而沉闷。

Be still,sad heart!And cease repining;
安静吧，忧伤的心！别再悔恨；

Behind the clouds is the sun still shining;
乌云后面太阳依然辉煌灿烂；

Thy fate is the common fate of all,
你命运和大家的一样，

Into each life some rain must fall,
每个人一生都得逢上阴雨，

Some days must be dark and dreary.
有些日子必然阴暗而沉闷。
