Lesson 1:Life Purpose
第1堂课：生活目标

The key to immortality is first living a life worth remembering.
不朽人生关键在于过一种值得让人记住的人生。

仅此一生而已，你需要尽力而为创造点什么，为你身边的人的生活增加些价值。

Lesson 2 : Limits
第2堂课：限制条件

If you always put limit on everything you do, physical or anything else. It will spread into your work and into your life. There are no limits. There are only plateaus, and you must not stay there, you must go beyond them.
如果你给每件事情都设了限，无论是有形的还是无形的，它都会融进你的工作和生活。没有极限，只有停滞不前，而你千万别停滞不前，你必须超越和突破。

Ever since I was a child I have had this instinctive urge for expansion and growth. To me, the function and duty of a quality human being is the sincere and honest development of one’s potential.
当我还是个孩子的时候，我就本能的渴求发展和成长，对我来说，一个人高品质的人生的作用和职责就是真正开发自己的潜能。

You will only grow to the limits that you place on yourself (and let others place on you). To truly reach your potential you must forget limits and realize you will never reach your full potential in this lifetime.
你给自己设限(或让别人为你设限)你只能到达设限点的高度而已。要真正发挥你的潜能，你必须抛开条条框框的束缚限制，否则此生你将永远不会认为自己会发掘出自己的全部潜能。

Lesson 3 : Happiness
第3堂课：幸福快乐

Be happy, but never satisfied.
要幸福快乐，却不满足于此。

Allow yourself to be happy now and don’t wait until you’ve reached some arbitrary goal. However, remember that everything in life is either growing or dying, so choose which one you prefer for your life.
现在就让自己幸福快乐起来，不要等到你达到随便某个目标时才让自己幸福快乐。不过请记住：人生只有生死两个状态，所以，选择自己比较喜欢的生活状态。

Lesson 4 : Self Image
第4堂课：自我形象

I’m not in this world to live up to your expectations and you’re not in this world to live up to mine.
我活着不是为了满足你的期望，就像你也不是因为我的期望而活着一样。

As you think, so shall you become.
你想成为什么样的人，就真的会成为那样的人。

You define yourself–no one else. So when you create an incredible self image for yourself you will naturally grow into your own amazing expectations.
自己明确自己的形象，而不是让别人来定义你的形象。所以在打造一个了不起的自我形象过程中，你自然会成长为让自己都出乎意料的形象。

Lesson 5 : Goals
第5堂课：设定目标

A goal is not always meant to be reached, it often serves simply as something to aim at.
目标，不一定总是要达到，目标往往只是用来帮助你瞄准方向。

Any goal can be reached when given enough time. So let go and just start moving in the right direction.
只要时间充裕任何目标都可以达到。所以，放开手开始朝着正确的方向前进。

Lesson 6 : Learning
第6堂课：不断学习

A wise man can learn more from a foolish question than a fool can learn from a wise answer.
一个聪明人，从愚蠢的问题上学到的东西要比一个傻瓜在一个聪明的答案上学到的要多。

Take no thought of who is right or wrong or who is better than. Be not for or against.
不想谁对谁错，谁好过谁，不支持，也不反对。

Always be open to the lessons around you no matter where they come from. Everything in life can teach you something if you are open to receiving the lesson.
坚持参加身边举办的这类课程。如果你乐意接受这类课程的培训，生活中的一切都能教你东西。

Lesson 7 : Action
第7堂课：付诸行动

Knowing is not enough, we must apply. Willing is not enough, we must do.
光是知道是不够的，必须加以运用。光是希望是不够的，非去做不可。

If you spend too much time thinking about a thing, you’ll never get it done.
如果你花费太长时间去想一件事，那你永远不会完成它。

Knowledge will give you power, but character respect.
知识会带给你力量，但人品会带给你尊重。

There are plenty of people in this world who know what they have to do to get what they want. The few that succeed are those who develop a character of constant and deliberate action.
世上很多人都了解自己该做什么自己想要什么。培养坚持不懈的性格经深思熟虑并付诸行动才能得以成功。

Lesson 8 : Focus
第8堂课：术业专攻

I fear not the man who has practiced 10,000 kicks once, but I fear the man who has practiced one kick 10,000 times.
我不怕一次踢腿10000次的人，但我怕把一个踢腿动作练了10000次的人。

There are many paths you can follow to reach your destination. However, you’ll never reach the end if you keep changing paths along the way.
到达目的地的途径有多种。但是，如果你沿途不断变换道路的话是永远不会到达终点的。

Lesson 9 : Time
第9堂课：珍惜时间

If you love life, don’t waste time, for time is what life is made up of.
若你热爱生命，就不要浪费时间，因为生命是由时间构成的。

We all start each day with 24 hours in the bank; the difference is what we do with it.
我们每人每天都在银行存了24小时：区别在于我们用这24小时做什么。

Lesson 10 ： Failure
第10堂课：失败受挫

Don’t fear failure. — Not failure, but low aim, is the crime. In great attempts it is glorious even to fail.
不要怕失败受挫。失败不是罪过目标太低才是罪过。大胆尝试虽败犹荣。

Failure is a natural part of the learning process for anything we do. No parent has ever watched their child fall while trying to take their first steps and said, “well, I guess they’re not a walker.” So why would you do this to yourself?
失败是我们学习做任何事情的过程中的一个自然组成部分。全天下父母看着自己的孩子试着迈出第一步时都不会说：“嗯，我估计这孩子不会走路。” 那么你为什么要这样对自己呢？

Lesson 11 ： Perseverance
第11堂课：坚持不懈

Do not pray for an easy life, pray for the strength to endure a difficult one.
不要祈求过一种轻松的生活，要祈求赐予你忍受困难日子的力量。

You are always going to have problems and challenges in your life. Success in any area is simply learning how to overcome bigger and bigger challenges.
生活中总有各种问题和挑战。在任何领域的成功都只不过是学着如何克服更大的挑战而已。

Lesson 12 ： Flexibility And Adaptability
第12堂课：灵活性&适应性

Be like water making its way through cracks. Do not be assertive, but adjust to the object, and you shall find a way around or through it. If nothing within you stays rigid, outward things will disclose themselves.
水滴石穿。不要独断专行，要适应目标对象，有目标有对象就会找到方法。如果内在不够坚定，外在会表露无遗。

Empty your mind, be formless. Shapeless, like water. If you put water into a cup, it becomes the cup. You put water into a bottle and it becomes the bottle. You put it in a teapot, it becomes the teapot. Now, water can flow or it can crash. Be water, my friend.
放空你的思想，透明的、无定形的、像水一样，如果你将水放入杯子，它就变成杯子的形状;你将水放入瓶子，它就变成瓶子的形状;你把水放入茶杯中，它就变成茶杯的形状;水可以柔软的流动，也可以坚硬的凝结，像水一样吧，我的朋友。

Become flexible and adaptable in your daily life and problems will roll off your shoulders. Tension is only created when results do not met our expectations or perception of how the world should be.
日常生活中变得有灵活性和适应性，面临问题才能迎刃而解。只有我们对这个世界的期望未实现时，才产生了压力。

Lesson 13 ： Simplification
第13堂课：简单化

It’s not the daily increase but daily decrease. Hack away at the unessential.
不是一天天的增加而是要一天天的减少，减去那些不必要的东西。

Adapt what is useful, reject what is useless, and add what is specifically your own.
要适应环境，拒绝无用的，再加上你自己的特别之处。

When you clear your life and mind of the unessential then amazing things start to happen. Be ruthless in asking, "does this serve my greater life purpose?"
明确你的生活和思想上的重要目标，那么神奇的事情就会出现。反问自己：“这是不是我人生的一大目标？”

第14堂课：人际关系

To know oneself is to study oneself in action with another person.

认识到这样一个道理：生活中你想要的东西都可以通过帮助别人来得到自己想要的东西。

Lesson 16 : Live In The Moment
第16堂课： 活在当下

Take things as they are. Punch when you have to punch. Kick when you have to kick.
处之泰然。当出拳则出拳;当踢腿则踢腿。

Always focus your attention on the present moment. Your past does not determine your future–that comes from what you do in this exact moment.
一直把注意力集中在当下。你的过去并不决定你的未来，关键在于你当下在做什么。
