<b>矿井 铁轨 羊</b>

There were these two guys out hiking when they came upon an old, abandoned mine shaft. Curious about its depth they threw in a pebble and waited for the sound of it striking the bottom, but they heard nothing. They went and got a bigger rock, threw it in and waited. Still nothing. They searched the area for something larger and came upon a railroad tie. With great difficulty , the two men carried it to the opening and threw it in. While waiting for it to hit bottom, a goat suddenly darted between them and leapt into the hole! The guys were still standing there with astonished looks upon their faces from the actions of the goat when a man walked up to them. He asked them if they had seen a goat anywhere in the area and they said that one had just jumped into the mine shaft in front of them! The man replied, ‘Oh no. That couldn’t be my goat, mine was tied to a railroad tie.

两个人出来远足遇到了一个古老废弃的矿井，为了知道矿井的深度他们向里面扔了一块鹅卵石，可过了许久也没有听到撞击底部的声音。于是他们找了一块更大的石头扔进去，依然什么也没听到。为了找到更大的物体他们搜寻了附近的区域，发现了一块铁轨的枕木，两人费尽力气将枕木拽到了矿井边，扔了进去。就在他俩等着听声的时候，突然一只羊窜了出来跑进了矿井里。俩个人惊诧的站在那里不知所措，这时一个人朝他们走来问是否在附近看到了一只羊，他俩回答道刚有一只羊跳进了矿井。这名男子说道，“哦，不，那不可能是我的羊，我把羊拴在铁轨枕木上了”。
