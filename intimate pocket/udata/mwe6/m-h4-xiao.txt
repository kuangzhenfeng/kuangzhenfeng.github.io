<b>疯狂的笑话：你不就想要那块小的吗</b>

One day, Bill and Tom went to a restaurant for dinner.
As soon as the waiter took out two steaks, Bill quickly picked out the bigger steak for himself.Tom wasn’t happy about that: “When are you going to learn to be polite?”
Bill: “If you had the chance to pick first, which one would you pick?”
Tom: “The smaller piece, of course.”
Bill: “What are you whining about then?
The smaller piece is what you want, right?”

一天，比尔和汤姆到一家餐厅吃晚饭。
当服务员端上了两份牛排时，比尔豪不客气地挑走了较大的那份。
汤姆不高兴地说：“什么时候你才能学会礼貌？”
比尔说：“如果给你机会先挑，你会选哪块？”
汤姆回答说：“当然是小的那块。”
比尔说道：“那你还有什么可抱怨的？你不就想要那块小的吗？”
