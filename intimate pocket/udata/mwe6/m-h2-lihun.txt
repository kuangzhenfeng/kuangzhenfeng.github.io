<b>《离婚律师》经典台词双语版</b>

爱情是什么？婚姻是什么？恐怕一千个人有一千个不同的答案。让我们看一下这位离婚律师的观点吧。

1. 我相信爱情，也相信爱情会死，在我看来没有什么是通过婚姻才能得到的，但两人之间最珍贵的感情只有通过婚姻才可能产生。
I believe in love and I also believe that love will die. In my eyes, nothing in the world can be achieved only through marriage, but the most precious affection between two individuals does grow out of marriage.

2. 人啊，难受是因为不自由，觉得不自由是因为自己的欲望膨胀。
People's unhappiness is a result of illiberality derived from a swelling desire.

3. 法律只保护财产，不保护感情
Laws only protect property rather than relationship.

4. 为什么离婚，就是要结束一段不好的感情，为什么要结婚，就是要开展一段有希望的新生活。
Divorce is a means of putting an end to an unhappy relationship, while marriage serves the purpose of opening a new chapter of life.

5. 你收拾一个男人你不能在结婚前，你得结完婚慢慢收拾。
Never give lessons to a man before marriage. You need to do it gradually after marriage.

6. 干律师这行，看见别人结婚，劝别人小心，看到别人离婚，要对别人说声恭喜。
As a lawyer, we need to say "take care" to newly-weds, while saying "congratulations"  to those who just divorced.

7. 如果说婚姻是契约，夫妻间的承诺是合同，那么你这种行为，就叫做合同欺诈。
If the marriage is an agreement, the promise between the couple is a contract. Thus, your behavior like this is nothing but a contractual fraud.

8. 离开一个错的人，才会遇到对的人。
You will not meet the right person unless you leave the wrong.

9. 女人经济越独立越不需要婚姻，投资男人不如投资自己。
For a woman, there is no need of marriage if she is economically independent. It is much wiser for a woman to invest in herself than in a man.

10. 谈恋爱，是跟一个人的优点在谈恋爱；谈结婚，是跟一个人的缺点在过日子。
Dating someone is actually dating with his or her merits, whereas marrying someone is actually marrying his or her demerits.
