摄影师和飞行员
 
The photographer for a national magazine was assigned to get photos of a great forest fire. Smoke at the scene was too thick to get any good shots, so he frantically called his home office to hire a plane. “It will be waiting for you at the airport!” he was assured by his editor. As soon as he got to the small, rural airport, sure enough, a plane was warming up near the runway. He jumped in with his equipment and yelled, “Let’s go! Let’s go!” The pilot swung the plane into the wind and soon they were in the air. “Fly over the north side of the fire,” said the photographer, “and make three or four low level passes.” “Why?” asked the pilot. “Because I’m going to take pictures! I’m a photographer, and photographers take pictures!” said the photographer with great exasperation. After a long pause the pilot said, “You mean you’re not the instructor?”
一名全国发行的杂志的摄影师被派去为一场巨大的森林大火取景。由于现场的烟雾太浓烈很难拍到好照片，于是他向总部申请要一架飞机。编辑向他保证到，“飞机会在机场等你！”当摄影师到达机场时果然看见一架飞机在跑道边热身。他扛着装备跳进飞机大喊，“走吧！走吧！”飞行员驾驶着飞机飞进空中。“飞越火灾北侧，”摄影师说，“做三四个低空飞行。”“为什么？”驾驶员问。“因为我要去拍照！我是一个摄影师，摄影师就要拍照！“摄影师非常恼怒的说。沉默一阵后，驾驶员说，“你是说你不是教练员吗？”
