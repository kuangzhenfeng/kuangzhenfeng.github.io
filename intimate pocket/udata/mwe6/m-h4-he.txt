<b>全扔进河里</b>

A preacher, completing a temperance sermon, spoke with great fervor! “If I had all the beer in the world, I’d throw it all into the river.”
With greater emphasis, he said, “And if I had all the wine in the world, I’d throw it all into the river.”
And finally he said, “And if I had all the whiskey in the world, I’d throw it all into the river, too!”
As he took his chair, the song leader stood and announced with a smile, “For our closing hymn, let us sing number 365:”
“Shall We Gather at the River.”

一位牧师在进行节制布道，他热情地讲着。“如果我有世界上所有的啤酒，我就把它们全部扔进河里！”
随后他又慷慨激昂地说，“如果我有世界上所有的葡萄酒，我就把它们全扔进河里。”
最后他说，“如果我有世界上所有的威士忌，我也会把它们全扔进河里。”
当他坐下后，唱诗班的领唱站起来笑着说，“最后的赞歌我们一起吟诵第365章：《让我们聚在河边》。”
