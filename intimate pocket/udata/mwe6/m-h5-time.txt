<b>时间都去哪儿了？盘点与time有关的表达</b>

时间匆匆忙忙就走到了3月，感觉刚刚穿上秋裤，就要开始挑夏天的凉鞋了。时间都去哪儿了呢？不要感慨了，今天来学学时间的表达！

It's already 9 March!!! Where has the time gone?! One minute I was bringing the Christmas tree down, the next minute I'm making preparations for spring and Easter.

I've said it before and I'll say it again, time seems to be flying by a bit too quickly for my liking. In this day and age of instant communication where the need to respond to email, What's App messages, Snapchat, Facebook and text messages is no longer an option but an absolute requirement. This expectation to respond immediately has meant that our days have become busier and busier so much so that 24 hours in a day are often not enough to accomplish all that we want to achieve.

Time has become a precious commodity or a limited resource both in our personal and working lives. There are in fact a lot of metaphorical expressions in English that show how valuable time is.

In this post, I've selected 12 expressions related to time that I found in Ian McKenzie's book "Financial English" that are frequently used in English. I have used a business context for the examples.
