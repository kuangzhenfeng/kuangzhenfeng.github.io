<b>叶芝：藏在文字中的少时伊人</b>

Down by the Sally Garden
偶过莎莉园
	 
My love and I did meet
吾与佳人遇

She passed the Sally Garden
伊过莎莉园

With little snow-white feet
纤足白如玉

She bid me take love easy
嘱我莫情痴

As leaves grow on the tree
情如苍翠漫松枝

But I being young and foolish
With her would not agree
倔强忤其意
年少又无知

In the field by the river
漫步小河畔

My love and I did stand
吾与佳人伴

And on my leaning shoulder
She laid her snow-white hand
玉手白如雪
斜斜扶我肩

She bid me take life easy
嘱我莫搏命

As the grass grow on the weirs
生如青草漫河堰

But I was young and foolish
彼时少且愚

And now I'm full of tears
而今泪涟涟
