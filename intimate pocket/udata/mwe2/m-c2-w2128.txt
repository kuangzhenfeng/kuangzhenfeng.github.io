<b>给21到28岁女人的十条忠告</b>

1、把重返校园充电认真列入计划，并在30岁前再次毕业。
1, Put the plan of returning to school seriously into schedule, and graduate before the age of 30.

2、永远玩得尽兴。
2, always play to your content. 

3、不要再把QQ、MSN的签名搞成针对实质性内容的抱怨。
3, do not then use the substantive content of complaints as your QQ or MSN's signature. 

4、以相同的价值观选择朋友，无论对方比你富有或贫穷。
4, select a friend with the same values, regardless of his economic situation. 

5、想不出喝什么就喝温水，想不出吃什么就吃蔬菜。
5, If you cannot think of anything to drink, then choose warm water; If you can not think of what to eat, then eat vegetables. 

6、不要总买打折货，容易造成潜在的自卑。
6, do not always buy discounted goods, which is likely to cause a potential self-esteem. 

7、看到喜欢的人就去接近、去搭讪,面子是次要的，拒绝之后反正谁也不认识谁。
7, Approach the people you like, face is secondary before 30 anyway. 

8、绝不会和超过32岁还在租房子住的男人约会，除非他租的是一级公寓。
8, Don't love a man over 32 living in a rented apartment. 

9、28岁前还不到要靠钱和地位来弥补自己吸引力的地步，但被别人单纯的看上外表也不再是值得骄傲的事。
9, simply a fancy appearance is no longer a thing to be proud. 

10、28岁以后，凭直觉去交往，凭经验去爱；28岁以前，两者相反。
10,after 28, please contact with intuition, love with your experience; and do the opposite things before 28.
