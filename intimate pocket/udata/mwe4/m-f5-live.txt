<b>生活中那些让你微笑的小事</b>

"The best things in life are free" is an oft-quote term, but is it true? We certainly think so, especially if you consider the 30 amazingly simple, beautiful, and absolutely free things below. Each one of them will definitely bring a smile to your face and those around you。
“生命中最美好的事物都是免费的”，这是一句经典格言，但这是真的吗?我们当然同意，特别是如果你想想下面这30件无比简单、美好、自由的事情。每一个都会使你和周围的人会心一笑。
