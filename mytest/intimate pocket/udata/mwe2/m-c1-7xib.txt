<b>这个七夕 特别的情书给特别的你</b>

Idea 1: Write a small but romantic love letter (about 5 lines in length or less). Then, get your local newspaper and circle all the words you need (in order) to include in your letter. Then leave the paper with a special note on top telling him to put together the words to form the letter.
创意1：写一封短小而浪漫的情书（不要多于5行）。找一份当地的小报，把情书上的每个字按顺序在报纸中圈出来。让TA用圈出来的字拼出那封情书。

Idea 2: Write a line or two of a 20 -30 sentence love letter on bits of paper or index cards. Hide the cards in various places and leave a hint on where to find the next part of the letter. The really adventurous might try leaving bits of the letter around your city.
创意2：在碎纸或卡片上写出一封20到30个句子的情书。将这些碎纸或卡片藏在不同的地方，在每个地方留下一个怎样找到下一片纸的小提示。当然，你甚至可以将碎纸或卡片藏在一个城市的不同地方~

Idea 3: Tape a few hours of TV shows. Watch the shows and pick out words that have been said and create a love letter out of them. Then re-record only those words in the correct order to make a video love letter.

创意4：用电子邮件把情书一句一句的定时发送给TA。
