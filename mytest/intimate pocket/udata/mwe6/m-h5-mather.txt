<b>一年只有一个母亲节 但我会用整个生命去爱她</b>

American President Woodrow Wilson made Mother’s Day a national holiday in 1914 and it has since grown to be celebrated in over 100 countries around the world. Most countries honor moms in March, April or May but a few, including Russia, Panama and Indonesia, celebrate much later in the year. In the U.S., the holiday is always celebrated on the second Sunday in May. Mother's Day is the biggest day for long distance phone calls and one of the biggest holidays for flower sales.
