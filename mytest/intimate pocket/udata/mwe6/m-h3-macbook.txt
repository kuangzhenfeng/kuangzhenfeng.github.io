Apple has revealed the world's thinnest laptop that experts say could pave the way for an 'iPad Mega' later this year.

苹果发布了世界上最薄的笔记本电脑。专家们认为这可能是为今年晚些时候发布大屏iPad做准备。

The new machine, called simply the MacBook, boasts a 12 inch screen and a full size keyboard - but is just 13.1 mm thin and weighs two pounds.

这台名称简洁(MacBook)，装备12寸屏幕和全尺寸键盘的新电脑仅有13.1毫米厚，2磅重。

It also boasts a radical new port, called USB-C, that allows it to use a single connector for power, and to hook up to other devices and even a TV.

它还带有一个叫做USB-C革命性新接口，可以用同一连接线充电或连接其它设备，甚至包括电视。

Experts say the machine blurs the line between the iPad, iPhone and Macbook range.

'It seems more iPad than Mac, and joins the two ranges together,' said Stuart Miles of Pocket-Lint.com.

Pocket-Lint.com的斯图亚特·米尔斯说“它同属iPad和Mac个两产品线，但看起来更像iPad而不是Mac。”

'It is also easy to see where the rumours of the iPad Pro came in. It's very easy to see how this could be turned into a large iPad, with a removable keyboard.'

“从MacBook可以很容易看到iPad Pro面市的端倪，它轻而易举就能变成一个带外接键盘的iPad。”

Apple's Phil Schiller boasted the firm had 'reinvented every technology in it.'

苹果高管菲尔·席勒自豪的宣称，苹果公司“重新发明了该产品中的每项技术”。

For instance, Apple has redesigned the keyboard, claiming it is four times more accurate.

There is an LED under every key, so the entire keyboard has a uniform glow and can be used in the dark.
